# Let's summarize what you've done here - AND - what you still need to do to ensure your contaminated site's climate resiliency!
1. You described your contaminated site's basics, including decision lifespan and major site components
2. You identified some important present and future climate hazards for your region
3. You thought about which climate hazards could impact each of your contaminated site's major components
4. You developed a summary that prioritized major hazards and identified some promising climate information for each one

# Your next tasks are:
5. Get this climate information and develop a tailored climate change summary report for your contaminated site
6. Use this report to understand how the likelihood and severity of each hazard will change in the future
7. Undertake impact, vulnerability or risk assessments for present and future conditions if you want to understand how these will change for each of your site's components over time due to climate change
8. Consider developing adaptation plans and actions to ensure your contaminated site's resilience, now and in the future!

# Well done, and good luck with using this climate information and training to increase your contaminated site's resilience to climate change!
